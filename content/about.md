I'm Tomi, a USMC veteran turned open source researcher. I focus on maritime OSINT — vessel tracking, sanctions evasion, shadow fleet operations, and documenting military strikes at sea.

I'm a published contributor at Bellingcat and a conflict monitor with Airwars. My investigative work has also appeared in The Intercept. Most of what I do involves pulling ship-tracking data, satellite imagery, and port records into something that holds up to scrutiny.

On the technical side, I build AI-assisted tools and workflows for open source investigations. The boring parts of OSINT — cross-referencing vessel identities, flagging anomalous routes — are where automation actually helps.

This site collects my published investigations, tools, and methodology notes.
