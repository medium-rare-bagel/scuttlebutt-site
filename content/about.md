I'm Tomi, a USMC veteran turned open source researcher and conflict investigator focused on Latin America, the Caribbean, and Eastern Pacific.

I specialize in maritime OSINT - vessel tracking, sanctions evasion, shadow fleet operations, and documenting military strikes at sea. Most of what I do involves pulling ship-tracking data, flight data, satellite imagery, and port records into something that holds up to scrutiny.

I'm an active member of the Bellingcat Volunteer Research Community and a conflict monitor with Airwars, where I document U.S. military operations and civilian harm in the Western Hemisphere. My investigative work has also appeared in The Intercept.

On the technical side, I build LLM-assisted tools and workflows for open source investigations. The boring parts of OSINT - cross-referencing vessel identities, flagging anomalous routes - are where automation actually helps.

I speak Spanish.
